```

Understanding how these components interact is essential for creating a functional and efficient Homelab.

### Computing Hardware

Compute infrastructure forms the backbone of a Homelab and typically includes servers and client machines. These can range from repurposed desktop computers to dedicated server hardware. These machines run various virtual machines or containers, enabling users to create and manage different computing environments.

- **Servers**: Dedicated server hardware, such as enterprise-grade servers, repurposed desktop computers, or rack-mounted servers. These servers run virtual machines or containers to create different computing environments.
- **Workstations**: High-performance desktops and laptops for various tasks, including development, testing, and running specific applications.
- **Microcontrollers**: Small devices like Raspberry Pi or Arduino for projects requiring low-power consumption or specialized functionalities.

### Networking Equipment

Networking components are needed for connecting the computing devices.

- **Routers**: Home routers for basic networking needs or enterprise-grade routers for more advanced configurations.
