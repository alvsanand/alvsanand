# Journey to Datahub.local

Hey there! If my previous post, [Embracing the Challenge](202401_embracing-the-challenge.md), you know I’m on a mission in 2024. The quest? Crafting my own Data Platform from scratch called [Datahub.local](https://www.alvsanand.com/datahub-local/). It’s not just about data – it’s about diving headfirst into the unknown, learning, experimenting, and enjoying the ride. In this article, we're going to map out the game plan for this adventure.

## Goals

Embarking on this project requires clear objectives. Let's delve into the goals that will shape my journey.

1. **Hands-On Experience**: Dive into practical applications to solidify learning.
1. **Self-Directed Learning**: Take charge of my educational path and explore diverse aspects of data management.
1. **Experimentation & Innovation**: Encourage creative problem-solving and novel approaches.
1. **Portfolio Development**: Build a showcase of skills and projects for professional growth.
1. **Real Experience**: Implement the acquired knowledge in real-world scenarios.

## What’s the game plan?

With the goals established, it's time to devise a concrete plan that will guide my efforts and actions.

1. **Create my own Homelab**: Opt for a cost-effective approach by building a Homelab using small ARM devices, steering clear of excessive cloud expenses.
2. **Deploy Base Components**: Establish the foundation for the Data Platform with a Kubernetes cluster. Bootstrap it with DevOps components like ArgoCD, Prometheus, Grafana, etc., ensuring security and performance.
3. **Build the Data Platform**: Design and deploy a tailored Modern Data infrastructure, aligning with personal requirements and preferences.
4. **Develop an E2E use case**: Develop a meaningful data project to gain practical experience and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the new tools. Move beyond the traditional "hello world" approach.

## Principles

Finally, every project needs a compass. So, here are some principles to keep things on track and fun.

- **Learn and Enjoy**: Prioritize the enjoyment of the learning process.
- **Set Budget and Time Constraints**: Be proactive by defining a budget and timeframe, allowing for efficient progress.
- **Flexibility**: Postpone tasks that don't contribute to enjoyment or learning.
- **Innovation**: Embrace new components, software, or techniques, even if they aren't the best – the goal is to innovate.

And there you have it, folks! This sets the stage for my project. Next up, I'll spill the tea on the hardware I've snagged as I gear up for the exciting phase of implementation. Stay tuned for the next update!
