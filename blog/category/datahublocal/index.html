<p>Ever noticed how easy it is to kickstart your app on Kubernetes locally? Just a couple of commands and boom – it's up and running! But let's face it, real-world setups are a whole different ball game.</p>
<p>Take my <a href="https://datahub-local.alvsanand.com/">Datahub.local</a> project, for example. It's not just a data platform; it's a whole ecosystem of things running on Kubernetes. I've also got monitoring, storage solutions, CI/CD pipelines and many more. So suddenly, The initial simplicity feels like a distant dream.</p>
<p><img alt="Kubernetes To-Do List" src="/img/kubernetes-to-do-list.png" width="80%" /></p>
<h3 id="1-select-a-kubernetes-distribution"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/04/02/yet-another-kubernetes-to-do-list/#1-select-a-kubernetes-distribution">1. Select a Kubernetes Distribution</a></h3>
<p>Choosing the right Kubernetes distribution is crucial, especially considering your specific needs and infrastructure requirements. Options range from full-fledged, self-managed distributions like vanilla Kubernetes to lightweight solutions tailored for low-end devices.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vanilla</strong>: Ideal for environments where customization and control are paramount, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">vanilla Kubernetes</a> offers the flexibility to tailor the cluster to your exact specifications. However, it may require more manual configuration and maintenance efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Managed</strong>: Platforms like <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine">Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/es/eks/">Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)</a>, and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/products/kubernetes-service/">Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)</a> provide fully managed Kubernetes clusters, abstracting away much of the underlying infrastructure management. They're great for teams looking to offload operational overhead and focus on application development.</li>

<p>A significant consideration for Homelab enthusiasts, especially those sourcing equipment internationally, is the impact of customs regulations.</p>
<p>As of July 1, 2021, a <a href="[EU law](https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/buying-goods-online-coming-non-european-union-country_en)">new EU law</a> has altered the landscape of importing goods from non-European Union countries, particularly from China. This legislation aims to level the playing field between Chinese and EU suppliers, but it introduces complexities for consumers.</p>
<p>Key changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goods under 150 euros: Consumers are subject to additional VAT charges, typically managed by the seller.</li>
<li>Goods over 150 euros: In addition to VAT, consumers must pay additional duties and fees, which can be time-consuming and costly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Navigating customs can be a daunting task, as I learned firsthand. The process often involves learning the intricacies of customs procedures and enduring unexpected delays and expenses. In my case, I encountered a three-week delay and unexpected fees for customs services and package handling.</p>
<p>For those residing in Spain, a helpful resource on customs regulations can be found in <a href="https://wise.com/es/blog/tasas-aduanas-espana">this</a> article, providing valuable insights into navigating the complexities of importing goods.</p>

<p><img align="left" alt="Embracing the Challenge" src="/img/embracing-the-challenge.jpg" width="35%" /></p>
<p>With over 15 years as a <strong>software engineer</strong>, my journey has been a rollercoaster of jobs across various companies and teams — some great, some not so much. One revelation that I had is <strong>how fast the technology evolves</strong>. In just a few short years, your tech portfolio can become outdated, a relic of a bygone era. Although I've never considered myself a genius, what I do possess is an <strong>unwavering determination and consistency</strong>. Identifying my weaknesses has been key, whether in personal growth or, in this context, keeping up to date. </p>
<p>As explained before, change is the only constant in the IT work and you must adapt to it, especially from a technological standpoint. Over the past decade, I dedicated significant time to staying current — a pursuit that has proven both <strong>gratifying and demanding</strong>. The knowledge acquired has empowered me to accomplish tasks that seemed unimaginable just a year earlier. The magic happens when you step <strong>out of your comfort zone</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's a brief compilation of activities to help you step outside your comfort zone:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seek Feedback:</strong> Actively gather feedback from peers to identify areas for improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Explore New Opportunities:</strong> If growth stagnates, don't hesitate to explore new job opportunities or challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Never Stop Learning:</strong> Learning is the lifeline of our industry. Constantly evolve by staying informed and acquiring new skills.</li>
</ul>
<p>And speaking of learning, here are some effective ways to do it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stay Updated:</strong> Engage with relevant sources such as Reddit groups, tech personalities, or media (YouTube channels, podcasts).</li>
<li><strong>E-Learning and Reading:</strong> Enroll in courses on e-learning platforms or dive into insightful books. These are particularly beneficial for beginners.</li>
<li><strong>Certifications Matter:</strong> Pursue certifications that are in high demand. It's a challenging journey but adds valuable personal experience.</li>
<li><strong>Dive into New Projects:</strong> Participate in open-source initiatives or start your projects for a more hands-on learning experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we enter the year 2024, I feel the need to take on something distinct, personal, and significant — an activity that propels me far beyond my comfort zone. Hence, I would like to start a new project called <a href="https://datahub-local.alvsanand.com/"><strong>Datahub.local</strong></a>. Over the upcoming months, my goal is to conceive, create, and sustain <strong>a personalized Data Platform</strong> that can be operated within the confines of my home. This will afford me the opportunity to engage in exploration, experimentation, and, most importantly, <strong>learn from failures</strong>. Additional details will be shared in forthcoming articles.</p>
<p><img alt="Datahub.local" src="https://alvsanand.com/datahub-local/assets/img/logo.png" width="40%" /></p>
<p>So, buckle up, because my new journey of <strong>reinvention has just begun</strong>.</p>
